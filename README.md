Model CRUD Generator for CodeIgniter
CodeIgniter is a very easy PHP framework, and most people 
will agree that it has a very detailed and easy-to-understand 
document which provide developers so much conveniences.
Somehow, there are some limitations on CodeIgniter as well. 
We know that for other frameworks such as Yii, a built-in tool 
(such as Gii) will help you to generate the Model CRUD codes for 
all those tables in your database, which will make your life much 
easier. For CodeIgniter, there is no “Official” tools provided. When 
you are developing a large scale projects which might associate 
with a big database, it might be a nightmare to create all those 
CRUD functions for your models.
So here is a simple “Model CRUD Generator” code for CodeIgniter. 
Please take a try on this code, any feedback will be appreciated!
